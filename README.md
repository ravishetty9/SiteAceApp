Instructionsless 
You are to make a website aggregator application. The purpose of the application is to allow users to share, discuss and rate pages they find on the internet. You are provided with some starter code which displays a simple list of websites. You can gain up to 70% by implementing the following features:

Users can register and login.

Users can post new websites if they are logged in. Websites posted by users should have an URL and a description.

Users can up and down vote webpages by clicking a plus or a minus button.

Websites should be listed with the most up voted site first. 

The listing page shows when the website was added and how many up and down votes it has.

Users can move to a detail page for a website (using routing). 

On the detail page, users can post comments about a webpage, and they are displayed below the description of the webpage.

Notes:
-Used 'meteorhacks:search-source' package for searching websites. You have to add check and ejson packages for the search-source to work.
-Used iron:router, momentjs:moment, ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3
